This project is focused on developing an automated lung cancer detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model analyzes histopathological lung tissue images to predict the presence of cancerous cells, aiding in early detection efforts for lung cancer. This work is based on a dataset of lung tissue histology images and utilizes pre-trained CNN models (EfficientNetB3) for robust feature extraction and classification.

Dataset
We use the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images dataset available on Kaggle, specifically working with a subset of 15,000 lung images. This dataset contains images of normal and cancerous lung tissue, enabling the model to learn and differentiate between benign and malignant samples.

Dataset Source: Kaggle - Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images
Images Used: Lung images only (15,000 images)
Methodology
Model Architecture
The project employs EfficientNetB3 as the base model for feature extraction, initially configured to adapt to the lung histopathology dataset. We now extend this architecture by integrating VGG16 to further enhance feature extraction capabilities, providing a dual-model approach for cancer detection.

Base Model: EfficientNetB3
Additional Model: VGG16
Purpose: Classify images as cancerous or non-cancerous
Training Process
The model was trained on the Kaggle platform, leveraging its resources to handle the large dataset. Key steps in the training process include:

Data Preprocessing: Images were resized and normalized for consistent input to the CNN.
Feature Extraction: Features were extracted using both EfficientNetB3 and VGG16.
Classification: A dense layer on top of the extracted features to classify images into cancerous and non-cancerous categories.
Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, and recall metrics were used to evaluate model performance.
Mathematical Model
The project includes a mathematical model explaining the CNN's inner workings, illustrating how convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers transform the input images into feature maps and final predictions.
